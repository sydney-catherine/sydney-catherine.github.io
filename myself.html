  <h1> All About Sydney Catherine</h1>
  <h4>
    <a href="http://batotoyetu.org"> This is my current dance company</a>
    Hey, My name is Sydney, Sydney Catherine to be exact, and here is alittle about me. I was born on Halloween on a friday night, crazy right, I know. Im scary I guess, LOL. Anyway my favorite color is purple(all shades), my favorite number is 8, I have one brother, named Myles who will be 22 on August 5th, and I looooooooooovvvvvve to dance. It's literally my favorite thing to do, I can't stay still. I know its wayyyyyy to early to be thinking about this because im 15(i will be 16 in 3months ayyyyyyyy),but I want to name my future daughter Jaelynn Alaina. I love the spelling of the name with the Jae, and even though I have a cousin named Elaina, I also love the spelling of Alaina, just beautiful. Oh and really random, but I really want to be a twin. I am obessed with twins for some odd reason, its crazy. I really want a twin sister and I have a feeling that if I did her name would be Madison, or something with a S. My dad wanted to name me Madison, because for one he really liked the name, and my brother is Myles, so he liked the M theme. Another thought for my name was going to be Soroya as well, because my dad's name is Roy. My dad didn't like that though, so my mom watched house party, and she loved the name sydney. Next topic, my future career, I want to have my open my own dance company, I really like being the boss, because I don't really like people telling me what to do. I love dancing and teaching dance, and seeing people do something I created. The only thing I am still confused on is the fact that having your own company requires a lot of money, and I don't know what I want to do in order to have that money, but I know my ultimate goal. </h4>

  <p id="color">My favorite dance genre is Hip Hop, Then african(which I am doing now), then probably Jazz, but I hate ballet with a passion. It moves way too slow, although I lost a little bit of my flex ability, and ballet would probably help my form and regain my flexability. I also love track, and my favorite trcak star, is Sha'Carri Richardson, she goes to lsu(lousiana state university)and I really look up to her. Just for the record the background is me on the first day of school, i was in the newspaper, I was so scared to leave my mom and go into the building, just in case you guys were wondering.
